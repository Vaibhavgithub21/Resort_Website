        <h4>We transform dreams into reality.

We tread softly across nature’s canvas, careful to leave it without blemish.

We strive to make a difference and create a better world: a world around our resorts in which our guests can get in touch with the simple joys that make vacations truly rewarding.<br>

We ensure that our presence enhances the land we are located in and uplifts the local communities around us.<br>

In simple words, we care… for nature and the local communities around our resorts which are a home away from home for our guests.<br>

Nature is our muse, our teacher she is also our mother who gave birth to two stunning resorts – the kurumba village resort and tea nest… organic, natural and as earthy as they come.<br>

The story of the two resorts continues to unfold as we try to reinvent ourselves and our offerings and endeavor to deepen our guest’s enjoyment and knowledge of this lovely corner of the country.<br>

Come follow us into an enchanting realm, our very own wonderland… Decompress, unwind in an environment where the outside world seems blissfully remote and happiness is within your grasp!</h4>
